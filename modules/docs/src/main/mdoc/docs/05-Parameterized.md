## Parameterized Queries

In this chapter we learn how to construct parameterized queries, and introduce the `Put` and `Write` typeclasses.

### Setting Up

Same as last chapter, so if you're still set up you can skip this section. Otherwise let's set up a `Transactor` and YOLO mode.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doobie.FPS
import doobie.Fragments
import doobie.HC
import doobie.HPS
import doobie.free.connection.ConnectionIO
import doobie.syntax.string.*
import doobie.util.ExecutionContexts
import doobie.util.Read
import doobie.util.Write
import doobie.util.transactor.Transactor
import cats.*
import cats.data.*
import cats.effect.*
import cats.implicits.*

// This is just for testing. Consider using cats.effect.IOApp instead of calling
// unsafe methods directly.
import cats.effect.unsafe.implicits.global

// A transactor that gets connections from java.sql.DriverManager and executes blocking operations
// on an our synchronous EC. See the chapter on connection handling for more info.
val xa = Transactor.fromDriverManager[IO](
  "org.postgresql.Driver",     // driver classname
  "jdbc:postgresql:world",     // connect URL (driver-specific)
  "postgres",                  // user
  "password"                   // password
)

val y = xa.yolo
import y.*
```

```scala mdoc:invisible
implicit val mdocColors: doobie.util.Colors = doobie.util.Colors.None
```

We're still playing with the `country` table, shown here for reference.

```sql
CREATE TABLE country (
  code       character(3)  NOT NULL,
  name       text          NOT NULL,
  population integer       NOT NULL,
  gnp        numeric(10,2)
  -- more columns, but we won't use them here
)
```

### Adding a Parameter

Let's set up our Country class and re-run last chapter's query just to review.

```scala mdoc:silent
case class Country(code: String, name: String, pop: Int, gnp: Option[Double])
object Country {
  implicit val read: Read[Country] = Read.derived
  implicit val write: Write[Country] = Write.derived
}
```

```scala mdoc
{
  sql"select code, name, population, gnp from country"
    .query[Country]
    .stream
    .take(5)
    .quick
    .unsafeRunSync()
}
```

Still works. Ok.

So let's factor our query into a method and add a parameter that selects only the countries with a population larger than some value the user will provide. We insert the `minPop` argument into our SQL statement as `$minPop`, just as if we were doing string interpolation.

```scala mdoc:silent
def biggerThan(minPop: Int) = sql"""
  select code, name, population, gnp
  from country
  where population > $minPop
""".query[Country]
```

And when we run the query ... surprise, it works!

```scala mdoc
biggerThan(150_000_000).quick.unsafeRunSync() // Let's see them all
```

So what's going on? It looks like we're just dropping a string literal into our SQL string, but actually we're constructing a `PreparedStatement`, and the `minPop` value is ultimately set via a call to `setInt` (see "Diving Deeper" below).

**doobie** allows you to interpolate values of any type (and options thereof) with a `Put` instance, which includes

- any JVM type that has a target mapping defined by the JDBC specification,
- vendor-specific types defined by extension packages,
- custom column types that you define, and
- single-member products (case classes, typically) of any of the above.

We will discuss custom type mappings in a later chapter.

### Multiple Parameters

Multiple parameters work the same way. No surprises here.

```scala mdoc
def populationIn(range: Range) = sql"""
  select code, name, population, gnp
  from country
  where population > ${range.min}
  and   population < ${range.max}
""".query[Country]

populationIn(150_000_000 to 200_000_000).quick.unsafeRunSync()
```

### Dealing with `IN` Clauses

A common irritant when dealing with SQL literals is the desire to inline a *sequence* of arguments into an `IN` clause, but SQL does not support this notion (nor does JDBC do anything to assist). **doobie** supports this via *statement fragments* (see Chapter 8).

```scala mdoc:silent
def populationIn(range: Range, codes: NonEmptyList[String]) = {
  val q = fr"""
    select code, name, population, gnp
    from country
    where population > ${range.min}
    and   population < ${range.max}
    and   code IN (${Fragments.commas(codes)})"""
  q.query[Country]
}
```

Note that the `IN` clause must be non-empty, so `codes` is a `NonEmptyList`.

Running this query gives us the desired result.

```scala mdoc
populationIn(100_000_000 to 300_000_000, NonEmptyList.of("USA", "BRA", "PAK", "GBR")).quick.unsafeRunSync()
```

### Diving Deeper

In the previous chapter's *Diving Deeper* we saw how a query constructed with the `sql` interpolator is just sugar for the `stream` constructor defined in the `doobie.hi.connection` module (aliased as `HC`). Here we see that the second parameter, a `PreparedStatementIO` program, is used to set the query parameters. The third parameter specifies a chunking factor; rows are buffered in chunks of the specified size.

```scala mdoc:silent
import fs2.Stream

val q = """
  select code, name, population, gnp
  from country
  where population > ?
  and   population < ?
  """

def proc(range: Range): Stream[ConnectionIO, Country] =
  HC.stream[Country](q, HPS.set((range.min, range.max)), 512)
```

Which produces the same output.

```scala mdoc
proc(150_000_000 to 200_000_000).quick.unsafeRunSync()
```

But how does the `set` constructor work?

When setting parameters in the high-level API, we require an instance of `Write[A]` for the input type. It is not immediately obvious when using the `sql` interpolator, but the parameters (each of which require a `Put` instance, to be discussed in a later chapter) are gathered into an `HList` and treated as a single writable parameter.

`Write` instances are derived automatically for column types (and options thereof) that have `Put` instances, and for products of other writable types. We can summon their instances thus:

```scala mdoc
Write[(String, Boolean)]
Write[Country]
```

The `set` constructor takes an argument of any type with a `Write` instance and returns a program that sets the unrolled sequence of values starting at parameter index 1 by default. Some other variations are shown here.

```scala mdoc:silent
// Set parameters as (String, Boolean) starting at index 1 (default)
HPS.set(("foo", true))

// Set parameters as (String, Boolean) starting at index 1 (explicit)
HPS.set(1, ("foo", true))

// Set parameters individually
HPS.set(1, "foo") *> HPS.set(2, true)

// Or out of order, who cares?
HPS.set(2, true) *> HPS.set(1, "foo")
```

Using the low level `doobie.free` constructors there is no typeclass-driven type mapping, so each parameter type requires a distinct method, exactly as in the underlying JDBC API. The purpose of the `Put` typeclass (discussed in a later chapter) is to abstract away these differences.

```scala mdoc:silent
FPS.setString(1, "foo") *> FPS.setBoolean(2, true)

```
